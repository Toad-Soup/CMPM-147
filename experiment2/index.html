				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I'm trying to replicate the accompanying image of Mount Whitney using generative methods!
					I began my journey knowing very little bout such methods but though this project I have become more comfortable With such processes. From making mountain shapes,
				To clouds that lazily drift across the screen, moving and reforming as time preogresses. Thanks to Prof Modes for letting me adapt his code for the clouds</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used methids like Noise(), Map() and Vertex() to make my own shapes, fill them with colors I selected, and put it all together to make the moutnain scene. I used code frmo my Professor and classmates to form the clouds, and make them lazily drift across the screne.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was a really fun lerning process. I will admit that p5.js had quite the leanring curve, but once I got the hang of what I was supposed to do it went much faster. I did use ChatGPT to help me debigg issues like the mountains not curving enough and the clouds looking pixelated and lagging my system. But other than that it was quite the interesting process</p>
